# voltage_divider
Calculation of output voltage in a simple voltage divider circuit. This project was made for my C++ and Data Structures class.

USER INPUT: Lines prompt the user to enter values for the input voltage and the resistors (r1 and r2), and the entered values are stored in the respective variables.

VOLTAGE DIVIDER CALCULATION: Lines calculate the output voltage (Vout) using the voltage divider formula: Vout = Vin - ((Vin * r1) / (r1 + r2)). The result is stored in the variable Vout. 

The program takes user input for the input voltage and resistor values, calculates the output voltage using the voltage divider formula, and then displays the result.
